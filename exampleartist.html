      <div class="artist-statement">
        Sandy is a Molecular Biology major. Her experiences in a genetics lab working on rare diseases, primarily craniosynostosis and
related syndromes, incited her interest in portraying children
with craniofacial anomalies. Moreover, she is passionate about disability, its marginalization in both society and portraiture, and the contentious future of eugenics in de ning a new class of disability. She strives to reveal the miracle that is a healthy-functioning individual, compelling viewers to deliberate on the unfathomably complex processes that underlie their organism. Inspired by Susan Sontag’s 1978 essay Illness as Metaphor, Sandy hopes to dismantle prevailing stereotypes about disability to encourage true empathy, acceptance, and learning. This body of work was motivated by the patients and researchers at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, and the artist expresses her gratitude for the sage counsel of her professors and advisors, particularly Eve Aschheim.
