        The Program in Visual Arts introduces students to the studio arts in the context of a liberal arts education. Offering courses in painting, drawing, graphic design, photography, sculpture, film and video, and film history and theory, the program provides enrolled students extensive contact with an internationally accomplished faculty as well as access to state-of-the-art technical, analog, and digital labs, including a fully functional letterpress studio. The facility at 185 Nassau Street also houses the James M. Stewart ’32 Theater for 35mm and 16mm film projections. Screenings, at least three nights per week, are open to all students.
